<h1>Project Introduction<h1>
Overview In the era of rapid technological advancements, the application of machine learning in various industries has become increasingly pivotal. This project focuses on leveraging the power of deep learning for image classification, specifically in the context of the automotive industry. We aim to develop a model capable of distinguishing between defective and good condition tyres based on digital images. This task is not only technologically intriguing but also carries significant implications for vehicle safety and quality control in tyre manufacturing.
