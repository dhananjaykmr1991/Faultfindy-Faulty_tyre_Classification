### Project Introduction
Overview In the era of rapid technological advancements, the application of machine learning in various industries has become increasingly pivotal. This project focuses on leveraging the power of deep learning for image classification, specifically in the context of the automotive industry. We aim to develop a model capable of distinguishing between defective and good condition tyres based on digital images. This task is not only technologically intriguing but also carries significant implications for vehicle safety and quality control in tyre manufacturing.
### Dataset
This dataset digital images of tyres, divided into two categories: 1,028 defective and 828 in good condition. Each high-resolution image is meticulously labelled to indicate the tyre's state. This comprehensive collection is ideal for machine learning and computer vision applications, specifically in image classification and object detection. It provides a balanced mix of conditions, offering a robust resource for algorithm training and testing in identifying tyre conditions from digital images.
